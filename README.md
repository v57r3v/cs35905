CHEN E4010 Mathematical Methods in Chemical Engineering 
Syllabus and Lectures Schedule – Fall 2024 
Welcome! CHEN   E4010 Mathematical Methods in Chemical Engineering is   a   rigorous   course   that   is   an   important   component   of the   foundations   of your   graduate   education   in   chemical   engineering.   I   love   math's inherent beauty and awesome power to   solve   practical   problems   in   almost   any   field.   In this course, you will be able to appreciate this in the context of   chemical engineering problems.

5. Course Objectives: 
a)      Be able to mathematically describe chemical   engineering problems   and   the   application   of   selected methods for their solution.
b)      Apply general modeling principles, including model hierarchies.
c)       Solve   linear   and   nonlinear   ordinary   differential    equations   and   their   systems,   including   those with variable coefficients.
d)      Solve    partial    differential    equations      in    Cartesian      and      curvilinear      coordinates    to      solve   chemical engineering   problems.
e)  代 写CHEN E4010 Mathematical Methods in Chemical Engineering Fall 2024SQL
代做程序编程语言     Hopefully,   to   learn   to   love   and   admire   mathematics   for   its inherent beauty and   almost magical power in   solving   practical   problems.
6. Classroom Procedures: 
a) What you should bring to class: A    calculator,    writing   implement,   a   notebook,   textbook,   and   computer laptop as   desired.
b) What not to bring to class: Anything   that   could   disturb   others   around   you.      Anything   that   would   distract you   or   others   from the   guest   speaker,   such as but not   limited to   a   plate   of food,   computer   games,   any   device   that   makes   sounds,   coursework   from   another   class,   social   media   connecting   devices, etc.
c) Be on time for class and actively participate. Being   on   time   for   class   means   you   are   seated,   ready to   take   notes,   solve   problems,   listen   to   lectures,   and   take   other   classroom   instructions   before   the   start time.   You are also expected not to chat and be distracted. This standard is adopted to provide   the   best   class   experience   possible.    Class   participation   is   part   of   your   grade.      You   must   be   in   class and   seated, ready to go at the   start   time.   If   you   are   found   to be   a   distraction,   you   may   be   asked   to   leave.
d) Web Site.   The website   for this   class   contains   important   administrative   and   scheduling   information   and                           is                           located                           at                           the                            Columbia                            Course                         Works                            website: https://courseworks.columbia.edu/welcome/;   I will update the   site with   lecture   slides   and   links to articles and resources as appropriate.
7. Course Grade: The   final   grade   in   this   course   will   be based   on points   awarded   according   to   the following   system:
a. Final grade:    50 % midterms (two midterms,   25%   each)   +   50   %   Final   exam
b. Rules for Exams: All exams are closed books and closed notes.      You   are not allowed to use any books or notes of   any sort during the exams, except for a “crib sheet” (one page, 8.5 x 11 inches, for   midterms, and two pages for   the   final   exam)   as   a   concise   set   of   notes   used   for   quick reference. You   are not   allowed to   use   cell   phones,   calculators,   computers,   or any device that allows   for data   storage   during   the   exams.
c. Final Exam: This is   like the   midterms,   except   it   will   be two hours long   and   covers   all   aspects   of   the   course.
8. Homework: Homework      problems      will      be      assigned,      and      completion      dates      suggested. However, homework will not be collected or graded. You are ultimately responsible for knowing all aspects of   the   problems.   To   help   you learn,   homework solutions will   be   made available   through   the TA one week after the homework has been posted.      Copying   solutions will   not   help you   learn   the                            material                            and                               is                            against                               Columbia                            University's                               Policy. (http://bulletin.engineering.columbia.edu/policy-conduct-and-discipline).       The   re-distribution    of the homework   solutions   in   CHEN E4010   is not   authorized.      The TA has   office   hours   should   you   need   assistance   or   clarification   with   the   homework   or   exams.    While   the   homework   in   the   math methods course is not graded, the homework is   still   an   assignment   for   a   student   in   the   course   and   is   assigned to help your   learning.   In   all   exams,   at   least   one   question   from   the homework   will   be   asked. This can be seen as an incentive to   do the homework regularly   and   diligently.
